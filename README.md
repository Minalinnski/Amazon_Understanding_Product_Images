# Amazon - Understanding Product Images
Given the large size of Amazonâ€™s catalog, there are many products that look very similar but contain small yet important differences that can only be found upon close inspection. A model that only analyzes trivial pixel-level differences would be inadequate, considering the variety of images that could be encountered. Thus, we developed a robust object detection model that detects big picture differences in product image pairs, if they exist. Utilizing a convolution neural network followed by GradCAM, our model determines if there are differences across images and places bounding boxes around the areas of difference for visualization. Additionally, we built a web-based UI that allows for humans to seamlessly use the model to analyze their own pictures.

# Inspiration
Project was largely inspired by J. Wu, Y. Ye, Y. Che, and Z. Weng. Spot the Difference by Object Detection. 2018. https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01051v1.

# Usage

## GradCAM Demo
To demo the project with the existing models, go into the folder 'model' and run 'python3 test_gradcam.py'. If you want to use a specific model, edit the dataset_size parameter in test_gradcam.py. If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux make sure you can display images using a tool such as XLaunch. Feel free to experiment with different GradCAM settings in test_gradcam.py such as using XGradCAM or experiment with the smooth settings. 

## Example
The demo will run the gradcam model on all image pairs in the Test_GradCAM folder. If you want to test your own images, place your image pair in a folder and place that folder inside Test_GradCAM. The following is a result we get when running test_gradcam.py using the default small model, GradCAMPlusPlus, aug_smooth=True, eigen_smooth=False.

## UI Demo
To run the UI, go to the UserInterface folder and run 'python3 manage.py runserver' and in your browser go to localhost (hhtp://128.0.0.1:8000/).
